# 🍄 MycoShield - Blockchain-Powered Cybersecurity Platform

**World's First Mycelium-Inspired Network Defense with Aptos Blockchain Integration**

AI-powered cybersecurity system that mimics fungal networks to detect threats and uses blockchain for decentralized security intelligence.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Run different security levels
mycoshield-app          # Level 1: Basic network detection
mycoshield-rl           # Level 2: AI-enhanced detection  
mycoshield-multimodal   # Level 3: Multi-source detection
mycoshield-enterprise   # Level 4: Complete security platform
mycoshield-blockchain   # Level 5: Blockchain-enhanced security
```

## 🧬 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

**Think of your network like a fungal forest:**
- **Network nodes** = Mushrooms in the forest
- **Data connections** = Underground fungal threads (mycelium)
- **Cyber threats** = Diseases spreading through the network
- **MycoShield** = Immune system that detects and stops diseases

**AI Detection Process:**
1. Monitor all network connections (like fungal threads)
2. Use Graph Neural Networks to spot unusual patterns
3. Mark suspicious nodes as "infected" (red spores)
4. Automatically isolate threats to protect the network

## 🔗 Why Blockchain? (Main Purpose)

**Think of Blockchain as a "Digital Security Notebook" that:**

### 📝 **Keeps Permanent Records**
- Normal way: Security incidents stored in files that can be deleted/changed
- **Blockchain way**: All security events written in permanent digital book that CANNOT be erased
- **Example**: When MycoShield blocks a hacker IP, it's recorded forever on blockchain

### 🤝 **Gets Multiple Opinions Before Acting**
- Normal way: One computer decides if something is dangerous
- **Blockchain way**: Multiple computers vote together to confirm if threat is real
- **Example**: 3 different security nodes must agree "192.168.1.100 is malware" before blocking

### 💰 **Rewards Good Security Work**
- Normal way: No rewards for detecting threats
- **Blockchain way**: Get paid in crypto tokens (APT) for finding real threats
- **Example**: Find malware = earn 100 APT tokens, false alarm = lose reputation

### 🌐 **Shares Threat Information Globally**
- Normal way: Each company keeps their own threat list
- **Blockchain way**: All companies share one global threat database
- **Example**: If Company A finds new malware, Company B instantly knows about it

### 🔒 **Requires Multiple Approvals for Big Actions**
- Normal way: One person can block entire networks
- **Blockchain way**: Multiple security experts must approve big decisions
- **Example**: Blocking 1000 IPs needs 3 out of 5 security managers to approve

**In Simple Terms**: Blockchain makes MycoShield's security decisions more trustworthy, permanent, and globally shared!

## 🤖 How AI Makes Decisions

**The AI can take 3 actions when it finds something suspicious:**
- **🟢 ALLOW**: Let it continue (probably safe)
- **🟡 MONITOR**: Watch it closely (might be dangerous)
- **🔴 ISOLATE**: Block it immediately (definitely dangerous)

**Learning Process:**
1. AI observes network behavior
2. Makes a decision (Allow/Monitor/Isolate)
3. Sees if the decision was correct
4. Gets better at making decisions over time
